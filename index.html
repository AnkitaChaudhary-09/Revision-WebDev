      <b>My Motivation</b>
      <pre>
      Since childhood, I've loved thinking about problems and finding ways to solve them. When I heard that a B.Tech degree is challenging and involves tackling real-world problems, I felt motivated to take it on.
      
      For me, technology isn't just about coding â€” it's about creating solutions that make life easier, like building useful websites and applications. That's what drives me every day to keep learning, experimenting, and growing as a developer.
